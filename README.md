# MusicClassifier_Model
This project aims to develop a robust music genre classification system that utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Neural Networks. The primary objective of the project is to accurately classify 1000 audio files extracted from the GTZAN Genre Dataset into ten distinct musical genres.

The dataset consists of 100 audio files for each genre, with each file lasting 30 seconds. To ensure accurate classification, the audio files were further divided into 3-second segments for feature extraction and classification.

The program was designed to achieve high accuracy scores using multiple classification models, thereby demonstrating their ability to classify the audio files correctly. By comparing the results of the different models, we can determine the most effective model for genre classification.

The project provides a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of each model, which can be used to enhance music classification systems for various applications such as music recommendation, content tagging, and playlist generation. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a reliable and efficient music genre classification system that can be used in a range of industries.
