# MusicClassifier_Model
This project focuses on developing a musical genre classification program that uses machine learning classification models, specifically K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Neural Networks. This program uses the GTZAN Genre Dataset and 1000 audio files for feature extraction and classification. It contains ten different genres of music, each with 100 audio files of 30 seconds, which we further divided into 3 seconds files. The high accuracy scores from each model demonstrate that they successfully correctly classified each audio file into one of the ten pre-selected musical genres.
